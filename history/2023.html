		<h3>Mechanical Details</h3>

		<p>
			The Phoenix weighs 55 pounds, has a length of 56”, a beam (<em>width</em>) of 30”, and has an overall height
			of 26”. It can generate thrusts of more than 25 pounds. A hull and superstructure made of carbon fiber
			allows for weight reduction which has the benefits of an increased thrust to weight ratio and ease of
			transportability.
		</p>

		<h3>Electrical Details</h3>

		<p>
			An AMD Ryzen 5 5600X on a ASUS ROG Strix X570-I motherboard with 32 GB RAM provides the main logic of the
			boat. A Ubiquiti Rocket point-to-point transceiver allows for a reliable, fast data connection to land
			control. An Arduino Mega is used for computer control of the two Blue Robotics T500 thrusters. A Velodyne
			Puck LiDAR paired with a Logitech webcam is used for the boat's sensing.
		</p>

		<h3>Software Details</h3>

		<p>
			A Docker-based software environment configured with ROS 1 Noetic ensures that the exact same software is
			present when testing on a computer and on the boat. The team uses Git as our version control system. Most of
			the team's code is written in C++, with several Python scripts for small tasks.
