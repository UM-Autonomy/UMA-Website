			<h3>Monohull Design</h3>	<!-- Was "Trimaran Design" -->
			<p>
				<!--
				The Phoenix takes advantage of a trimaran design to maximize stability and minimize water
				plane area. This design significantly reduces water resistance and enhances speed and
				maneuverability. At the 2023 RoboBoat competition, Phoenix demonstrated the exceptional
				strength of this design by successfully navigating high winds - a challenge that other teams
				were unable to meet. The Phoenix weighs 40 pounds, has a length of 56”, a beam (<i>width</i>) of 30”,
				and has
				an overall height of 26”. It can generate thrusts of more than 30 pounds.
				-->

				The vessel utilizes a 5-foot carbon fiber monohull with a 15-inch beam, scaled up from the "Orca" platform. 
				A new longitudinal fin keel maximizes roll stability in wave environments, while an internal polycarbonate 
				chassis provides a rigid mounting surface that lowers the center of gravity for optimal hydrodynamics.
			</p>
			<!-- This used to be there, don't think it's required -->
			<!-- <br />
			<p>
				Constructed from carbon fiber, Phoenix's hull combines robustness and reduced weight thanks
				to this material's superior strength-to-weight ratio. The carbon fiber ensures increased
				durability of the hull and contributes to the lighter overall design, boosting the vessel's
				performance in various conditions.
			</p> -->

		</div>
		<div class="row" data-seconds="0.001" data-highlight="Camera">
			<h3>Camera</h3>
			<p>
				<!-- Old -->
				<!-- The Phoenix's camera provides the main input to the boat's autonomous capabilities. Using
				the YOLOv8 computer vision algorithm, all competition elements are detected. -->

				Visual data is processed by an upgraded YOLOv11 neural network. To ensure robustness, the team leverages Masked 
				Diffusion Models to generate photorealistic synthetic training data, allowing the autonomy system to learn from diverse, 
				computer-generated scenarios that are difficult to replicate in physical testing.

			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="row" data-seconds="0.333" data-highlight="Velodyne">
			<h3>LiDAR</h3>
			<p>
				<!-- Old -->
				<!-- The Velodyne Puck (previously known as VLP-16) provides the boat with a 3D map of its
				surroundings. Using detection data from the camera, the LiDAR provides supplemental depth
				data to determine objects' distance. -->

				The perception stack features a targetless LiDAR-camera calibration system. Instead of manual markers, 
				the software uses AI feature detection to align natural scene geometry between the LiDAR point cloud and camera 
				feed, ensuring precise sensor fusion and depth estimation.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="row" data-seconds="1.333" data-highlight="Brep.017,Brep.018">
			<h3>GPS Antennas</h3>
			<p>
				<!-- Old -->
				<!-- Dual antennas enable the boat to ascertain its heading with remarkable sub-degree accuracy.
				This precision reduces reliance on magnetic sensors, thereby mitigating any potential
				inaccuracies or inconsistencies due to magnetic disturbances or anomalies in the
				environment. This positions the vessel for superior navigation performance under a variety
				of conditions. -->

				Dual antennas provide sub-degree heading accuracy independent of magnetic sensors. 
				This mitigates errors caused by environmental magnetic anomalies, ensuring reliable orientation for navigation tasks.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="row" data-seconds="2.333" data-highlight="Thruster Left,Thruster Right">
			<h3>T500 Thrusters</h3>
			<p>
				<!-- Old -->
				<!-- Two Blue Robotics T500 Thrusters provide the Phoenix with powerful thrust. By placing the
				thrusters below the hulls to allow clean water flow at the inlets, ventilation is avoided. -->

				Two Blue Robotics T500 thrusters are mounted vertically in a differential thrust configuration. 
				Positioned deeper and further aft than previous designs, this setup maximizes turning leverage (moment arm) 
				and eliminates ventilation (air intake) for higher propulsive efficiency.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="row" data-seconds="2.5" data-highlight="Brep.022">
			<h3>Ubiquiti Rocket</h3>
			<p>
				<!-- Old -->
				<!-- A high-performance, high-range WiFi system allows high speed (around 500Mbps) communication
				between the boat and shore. -->

				A high-performance Ubiquiti Rocket system ensures reliable, 500Mbps low-latency communication between 
				the vessel and shore control.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="row" data-seconds="4.833">
			<h3>Electrical Box</h3>
			<p>
				<!-- Old -->
				<!-- Our vessel's electrical parts are housed in the electrical box. It is easily removable to
				allow servicing outside the hull. -->

				The compact enclosure prioritizes thermal management and modularity. By transitioning to integrated PCBs, 
				the design minimizes internal wiring volume, improving airflow and allowing for rapid 
				component swapping during maintenance.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="row" data-seconds="5.75" data-highlight="Battery">
			<h3>6-cell Lithium Battery</h3>
			<p>
				<!-- Old -->
				<!-- A 22.2 Volt, 222 Watt-hour battery provides the boat with a powerful electricity source. -->

				A central 22.2V, 222Wh lithium battery serves as the primary power source, positioned 
				low in the hull to maintain proper vessel trim and stability.

			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="row" data-seconds="6.54" data-highlight="PCB">
			<h3>Custom Printed Circuit Board</h3>
			<p>
				<!-- Old -->
				<!-- Motor control is provided by the team's custom PCB. This board is responsible for receiving
				motor control signals from the computer and remote controller. It also acts as the remote
				emergency stop by cutting power to motors if remote control signal is lost. To ensure safety
				and reliability, its firmware is written in Rust, a low-level but memory safe language. -->

				Custom boards replace bulky wiring harnesses for motor control and power distribution.
				 These integrated circuits reduce physical footprint and failure points, while serving 
				 as a hardware-level emergency stop to cut power if the remote signal is lost.

			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="row" data-seconds="7.458" data-highlight="VN300_Rugged">
			<h3>VN-300 GPS and IMU</h3>
			<p>
				<!-- Old -->
				<!-- The VN-300 provides inertial sensors, dual GPS receivers, and sophisticated Kalman filtering
				algorithms. This combination provides extremely accurate estimates of the vessel's position,
				velocity, and attitude. It ensures unmatched performance under both static and dynamic
				conditions, providing high precision direction data for the vessel's navigation tasks. -->

				The VectorNav VN-300 provides the precise state estimation required for the new "Memory" 
				architecture, which persists object locations in a global map to aid relocation. This data feeds a 
				Dynamic A planner* (smac_planner), allowing the vessel to generate continuous, kinematically feasible 
				paths that account for the boat's turning radius.

			<h3>Beelink SEi12</h3>
			<p>
				<!-- Old -->
				<!-- Featuring an Intel i5-12450H processor and 16GB RAM, this compact computer outperforms many
				similar-sized alternatives. Despite its superior performance, it maintains impressive
				efficiency with an idle power draw of just 5 Watts. The processor's integrated graphics
				enhance computer vision tasks, delivering outstanding results. The computer is outfitted
				with a 1 Terabyte drive to store data from competition runs. -->

				Featuring an Intel i5-12450H processor and 16GB of RAM, this compact computer delivers superior 
				performance with a highly efficient 5-Watt idle draw. Its robust integrated graphics accelerate the 
				real-time inference required for the upgraded YOLOv11 and Masked Diffusion pipelines, while a 1 Terabyte 
				drive stores extensive competition logs.

			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				<!-- Old -->
				<!-- A Docker-based software environment configured with ROS 1 Noetic ensures that the exact same software is
				present when testing on a computer and on the boat—allowing team members to use their choice of Linux,
				Windows, or macOS on their personal computers without differences. The team uses Git as our version
				control
				system. Most of the team's code is written in C++, with several Python scripts for small tasks. -->

				To ensure reliability, a Docker-based environment configured with ROS 2 guarantees identical software 
				behavior across simulation and hardware. This setup supports the team's C++ and Python codebase, managed 
				via Git, allowing for seamless integration across different operating systems.
