title: Vacuum Infusion
description: In previous years, the team utilized pre-resin-impregnated, high-temperature curing carbon fiber cured in an autoclave to construct the hulls. This year, the hulls were constructed using a carbon fiber vacuum resin infusion process. Each demi-hull was fabricated using a machine-milled high-density foam mold produced for the team by the Ford Motor Company.
