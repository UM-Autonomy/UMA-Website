title: Electrical Box Reorganization
description: Our main focus this year was to make the box more organized, neat, and reliable. To achieve these goals, we introduced numerous new parts and custom PCBâ€™s. For example, this year we purchased a breakout board, which splits an ATX cable into its derivative voltage supplies. We also overhauled nearly every single electrical splice connection and adopted a more crimp-oriented approach as opposed to soldering everything.
