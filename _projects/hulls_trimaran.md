title: Trimaran Hull Design
description: This year, we made some innovative changes to our original monohull design. We changed our hull design to a trimaran design to increase boat stability. Specifically, it reduced downward pitch when going forward, which was caused by the additional weight due to sensors and mounts at the front of our boat.
