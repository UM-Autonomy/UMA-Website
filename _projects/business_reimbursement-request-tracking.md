title: Reimbursement Request Tracking
description: Previously, our reimbursement process involved uploading receipts to a shared drive and notifying an Authorized Signer in the team. When preparing the team budget, we realized how challenging and tedious it was to match the receipts with SOAS account records of reimbursements. To solve this problem, we created a Google Form to help with the recording and tracking of reimbursement requests.
