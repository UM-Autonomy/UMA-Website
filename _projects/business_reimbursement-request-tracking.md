title: Reimbursement Request Tracking
description: We currently have a Google Form that requires separately uploading receipts for member reimbursement requests. While far better than the previous system involving manually notifying a team officer, we hope to introduce a streamlined system that allows receipt and description uploading quickly, which then immediately notifies the relevant person for purchase approval.
