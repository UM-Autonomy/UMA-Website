title: New Electrical Box
description: Over the past couple of years, we have been utilizing custom-cut polycarbonate to construct the main “shell” of the electrical box. This year, we used a pelican box - a rigid, waterproof, and air-tight crate. In order to drill holes in the box for some inputs and outputs, we needed to expose members to different tools needed to penetrate the thick material. Although this process was time consuming, all of the sub-team members were able to contribute, learn a new skill, and the electrical box was completed almost two months ahead of where it was last year. We also built our electrical box based on a CAD model designed and completed last summer.
