title: Drone Design
description: A custom designed H-frame was fabricated to increase stability in flight and allow for a space-efficient payload delivery mechanism. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, reduced working capabilities prevented aluminum fabrication as was seen in previous iterations of the team’s UAV solution. Instead, prototyping and final fabrication of all components excluding 4 carbon fiber frame tubes were manufactured using the team’s 3D printer.
