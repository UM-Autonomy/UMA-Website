The boat will identify the collection zone, which is an octagon floating on the water's surface. Once the area is detected, the ASV will then proceed to collect designated itemsâ€”floating rubber ducks and red racquetballs. The detection will be mainly facilitated by our camera-based computer vision system.

After successfully collecting the items, the ASV will navigate towards the Delivery Octagon. Here, the vehicle's primary task is to safely deliver the collected items. Points are awarded for not only delivering the items inside the octagon but also if items are delivered to the correct 'nests'. 

Throughout the process, the ASV needs to maintain efficient object handling and accurate navigational capabilities, which will be key to succeeding in this demanding challenge. The design and functionality of our vehicle will rely heavily on optimal strategies and technological advancements.
