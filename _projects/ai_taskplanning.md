title: Task Planning
description: The task planning team acts as the brains of our boat - it analyzes perception data in order to direct the movements of path-planning and controls. This will include creating an advanced movement library that interfaces with the path-planner/controller, enabling our boat to strafe, activate anchor mode, maneuver the boat relative to an obstacle, and circle around an obstacle. Expanding the boat’s current high-level logic capabilities, this new library interfaces with perception, path-planning, controls, and simulation. Task-planning members will achieve a broad understanding of all of the boat’s sub-teams. This team is great for someone who likes abstract, critical thinking without having to spend lots of team reading through ROS documentation, academic articles, or complicated math.
