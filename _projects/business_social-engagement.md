title: Social Engagement
description: Last year, the Business Team was able to organize more social engagement events with the funding opportunities provided by the Central Student Government (CSG) for student organizations. We organized a virtual Burger Night in Fall 2020 and reimbursed members who participated for the cooking ingredients. We also purchased Minecraft licenses for team use and a Realms subscription, pathing the way to Minecraft game nights in Winter 2021.
