title: Hydrophone Array and Processing
description: We use an array of 4 hydrophones in a rectangular fashion to find the pinger for acoustic docking. Our design for the hydrophones is to use a Raspberry Pi as our processing power and then communicate via USB to the main computer. In order to reduce interference, the hydrophones are placed at the very bottom of the boat. They are placed in a rectangular fashion to determine both the direction and the angle of the pinger, as compared to a straight line in which the pinger would have 2 possible locations.
