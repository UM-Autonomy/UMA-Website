title: LIDAR quantification
description: The Lidar quantification project’s goal is to explore metrics to evaluate our current LIDAR detection algorithm. These metrics give a more precise, fine-grained measure on the quality of the LIDAR detection than our current method of using a visualizer to holistically observe the results of the detection.  Members will gain experience with researching and conceptualizing various evaluation metrics, then evaluating the “informativeness” of each metric using a small, annotated 3D point cloud dataset. Potential metrics include those typically used in the fields of machine learning or data science, as well as custom metrics that we may formulate ourselves.
