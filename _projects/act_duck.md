This challenge will consist of three major steps: target recognition, calculating the water trajectory, and actuation. For target recognition, we will use camera-based computer vision system to detect and pinpoint target locations accurately. When it comes to trajectory calculation, we will calculate based on the position and orientation of both our vessel and the target.
The actuation step will involve using the data gathered from the previous steps to properly align our water cannon. Once the cannon has been aligned, the water will be launched.
To maintain "station keeping"—keeping our vessel still during the water launch—we will use force estimates to apply an opposite force via thrusters.
