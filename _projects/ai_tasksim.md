title: Task Sim team
description: The Task Sim teamâ€™s goal is to build a simulated version of the RoboBoat competition tasks with Gazebo in order to test our boat code without an actual boat or water. This will involve testing the boat code as a single unit in its ability to traverse course obstacles, as well as constructing metrics to quantify and compare the performance of specific sections of the boat. Since we have a working simulator and some foundational code for path verification from previous semesters, existing code will be used and improved upon. Members of this team will gain experience with each section of the codebase, from perception to motion-modelling, by interfacing with and testing them, as well as experiencing simulation/physics engines.
