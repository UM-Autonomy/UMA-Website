					2019: Daedalus
				</h3>
				<p class="editable">
					We came out of 2018 with the right balance of optimism and frustration with the result of competition. 
					We wanted to make a change and Daedalus is the culmination of every sub team going above and beyond anything we have 
					ever attempted on this team. Daedalus is the first Carbon Fiber boat in the team’s history, it’s the first time we
					 have used a custom implementation of Robot Operation System (ROS), and the first time overhauling almost every piece 
					 of hardware we have both on, and inside the boat. Joined by the team’s first entirely custom drone, Icarus, our entry into 
					 RoboBoat 2019 is perhaps our most daring attempt yet. Detroit as whole, and our biggest supporters in Michigan are making a comeback, 
					 we’ve stepped up to do our part too.

					2018: John Sea Na
				</h3>
				<p class="editable">
					2018 gave our team a glimpse of our potential for the future. 
					As a predominantly Sophomore and Junior team we recognized the need to target specific areas 
					in order to return the team to success. We focused on team organization, system engineering and 
					collaboration across groups. By making targeted improvements as a team, we were able to make significant 
					progress at competition. After previously not making it into finals the year prior, we were headed into finals in
					 4th and finished 3rd among American Universities. We see this year as an incredible opportunity to build on the experience 
					 of a majority upperclassmen team and strive to win the 2019 RoboBoat competition.
