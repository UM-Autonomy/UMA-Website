      <p>
        RoboBoat is an international competition where students design, build, and compete with
        self-driving robotic boats, in a series of tests aimed at challenging teams through a
        variety autonomous (self-driving) tasks. In 2023, we were joined by 22 other teams from 4
        continents.

    <h2>Competition Strategy</h2>
    <div class="my-4">
      <p>
        For this competition season, we tested with the 2022 hull (itself a refurbished 2017 hull)
        for most of the year, since it was already built. <a
          href="{% include relative-src.html src='/history/2023/' %}">A new hull made of carbon fiber</a> was
        being built concurrently by the mechanical team. At the last minute, days before departure for
        the competition, it was ready. The team spent the weekend preparing the new boat for the competition,
        and thanks to simulator testing, this process went smoothly and few code changes were needed.

    <h3>Static Judging Criteria</h3>
    <p>
      Besides a team's performance autonomously, we are judged on aspects of both our team and the
      boat.
    </p>
    <h4>Design Documentation</h4>
    <p>
      The team must prepare a website, <a
        href="{% include relative-src.html src='/technical_design_report/phoenix.pdf' %}" target="_blank">a technical
        design report</a>, and
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxFV9WLaQ88" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a video</a> for judges to
      score. These are evaluated based on how well they introduce the team and its structure
      as well as design considerations of the boat.
    </p>
    <h4>Presentation</h4>
    <p>
      The team must present to the judges live their decisions leading to the design of the boat.
    </p>
    <h3>Other Judging Criteria</h3>
    <p>
      Before the boat can participate in an autonomous challenge, several prerequisite activites
      must be completed.
    </p>
    <h4>Static Safety Inspection</h4>
    <p>
      As the boats are very high powered, a runaway boat could damage itself and hurt others.
      Therefore, competition staff ensure that the boat follows several safety rules:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The boat stops when a physical red button is pressed on the boat</li>
      <li>
        The boat stops when a remote switch is flipped, or the remote switch loses power or
        connection
      </li>
      <li>
        The boat does not have any sharp edges so that people in the water can touch the boat safely
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      UM::Autonomy is proud to have been one of the first three teams to pass the safety inspection
      at the 2023 competition.
    </p>
    <h4>Boat Thrust-to-Weight Ratio</h4>
    <p>
      The competition rewards fast and light craft. Therefore, a sliding scale is used where points
      are lost faster the heavier it gets. The boat is weighed and its thrust is measured every day
      it is entered in the water. In 2023, UM::Autonomy's boat weighed 55 pounds, the lightst weight
      class.

    <h3>Navigate the Panama Canal</h3>

    <dl>
      <dt>Description</dt>
      <dd>
        This challenge is mandatory before attempting other tasks. The ASV needs to pass through two
        sets of gates (a pair of red and green buoys) and starts autonomous navigation at a minimum
        of 6 ft before the set of gates.
      </dd>

      <dt>Analysis</dt>
      <dd>
        As it is mandatory, this challenge is of high importance. In 2019, the boat could only
        successfully pass the navigation channel once out of four qualification runs as a result of
        a major electrical failure onboard.
      </dd>
      <dt>Goal</dt>
      <dd>14 out of 15 successful runs</dd>
      <dt><span class="nowrap">Post-competition Remarks</span></dt>
      <dd>
        As one of the simplest tasks, this was completed with high success. However, additional
        tuning was needed upon arrival to the competition site as the boat's computer vision system
        would occasionally fail to detect a buoy.

      <dt>Description</dt>
      <dd>
        The ASV passes through between multiple sets of gates (pairs of red and green buoys) The ASV
        also avoids intermittent yellow buoys (jelly fish) and black buoys (manatees) of various
        sizes and counts them.
      </dd>

      <dt>Analysis</dt>
      <dd>
        The challenge requires minimal external hardware or software development and mainly just
        involves careful navigational operability and fine motor control. This challenge could be
        tested and fine-tuned early in the development process.

      <dt><span class="nowrap">Post-competition Remarks</span></dt>
      <dd>
        This challenge revealed some disadvantages of our indoors testing area. Specifically, our
        obstacle-avoidance system decided that the best way to avoid hitting buoys was to go outside
        of the red-green channel! While technically following our instructions, it didn't score many
        points. Although we didn't have time to fix that during the competition, the boat did go
        through several red-green pairs on some runs scoring us important points.

      <dd>
        The ASV enters the gate buoys, maneuvers around the mark buoy, and exits thought the same
        gate buoys, as quickly as possible. The timer starts when the bow (front) crosses the gate
        buoys and stops when the stern (back) crosses the gate buoys.

        <p>The team colloquially refers to this as the "Speed Challenge".</p>
      </dd>

      <dt>Analysis</dt>
      <dd>
        Based on the 2019 score-sheet, a time between 25-45s is needed to remain competitive in the
        Northern Passage challenge, with the fastest 2019 run coming in at 27 seconds.
      </dd>
      <dt>Goal</dt>
      <dd>
        9 out of 10 successful runs. We hope for a baseline of 35 seconds, and a goal of 26 seconds.

      <dt><span class="nowrap">Post-competition Remarks</span></dt>
      <dd>
        Another disadvantage of indoors testing was highlighted here: buoy interference.
        Specifically, our computer vision system had a hard time distinguising the blue buoy
        (marking where to turn around) from the black buoys (marking an obstacle to avoid in the
        previous challenge, Magellan's Route). When we tested indoors, we only tested one or two
        challenges at a time, and with different lighting.

      <dt>Analysis</dt>

        This is the first season with this challenge and hardware and software development of

        Although we had planned to focus on shooting water rather than balls, it turned out that
        water leakage was a big worry: if the pump failed and dumped water in the boat's
        electronics, we wouldn't be able to compete anymore. As such, we re-focued our effort on
        Feed the Fish. We finally had a working ball-shooting system while at the competition site,
        but lack of testing time meant that it couldn't be integrated in time.

        <p>
          Both tasks only had three teams that could shoot anything. No teams landed balls in the
