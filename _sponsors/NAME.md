description: Our program was started in 1879 with an act of Congress authorizing a Navy officer to teach “steam engineering and iron shipbuilding.” Since this modest beginning, NAME has grown into a world-wide leader in education and research, with 25 faculty and 11 staff, serving our undergraduate and graduate students along with a network of some 3,000 living alumni. Our department continues to develop engineers and technology to advance the state-of-the art for systems operating in the marine environment.
