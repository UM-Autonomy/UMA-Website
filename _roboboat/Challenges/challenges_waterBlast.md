priority: low
title: Water Blast
description: The ASV detects the target face (blue/white striped) and shoots enough water through the 
        target to raise the ball above the green line in the pipe
analysis: This is the first season with this challenge and hardware and software development of external 
        mechanisms pushed back actual testing. Therefore, we knew that immediate mastery of this task 
        would be difficult and time consuming, and should only be attempted after other challenges.
goal: 3 out of 5 successful runs
