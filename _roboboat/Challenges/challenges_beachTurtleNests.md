title: Beaching & Inspecting Turtle Nests
description: Before the time slot starts, teams are assigned a color and must dock at the bay with 
             the matching color. Once the ASV detects and enters the docking bay, it must report the number
             of "eggs" (number of circles) in the nest.
analysis: This challenge is a bit more involved in terms of CV and color/shape recognition but does not 
        require external hardware development.
goal: 9 out of 10 successful runs
