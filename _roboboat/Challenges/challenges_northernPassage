title: Northern Passage Challenge
description: The ASV enters the gate buoys, maneuvers around the mark buoy, and exits
        thought the same gate buoys, as quickly as possible. The timer starts when the bow (front) 
        crosses the gate buoys and stops when the stern (back) crosses the gate buoys.
analysis: Based on the 2019 score-sheet, a time between 25-45s is needed to remain 
        competitive in the Snack Run challenge, with the fastest 2019 run coming in at 27 seconds.
goal: 9 out of 10 successful runs + baseline of 35 seconds, goal of 26 seconds
