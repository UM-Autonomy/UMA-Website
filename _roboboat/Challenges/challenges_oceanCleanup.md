title: Ocean Cleanup
description: The ASV detects an underwater pinger which designates the area to collect "debris" (raquetballs) 
             from. The ASV may then use the collected balls as extra balls in the Feed the Fish challenge.
analysis: As this task is a new challenge, UM::Autonomy chose to focus on completing the Ponce de Leon challenge 
          and Feeding the Fish challenge for this year, though work was done throughout the year to
          complete the Ocean Cleanup task in the future.
goal: N/A
