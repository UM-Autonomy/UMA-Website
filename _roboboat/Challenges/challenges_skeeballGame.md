category: challenges
priority: low
title: Skeeball Game
description: The ASV detects the shooting gate (purple frame), then lines up and shoot three balls. More 
        points are awarded if the ball sunk into the smaller hole at the back, and some points are awarded 
        for just making the ball go on the deck. 
analysis: As both the Water Blast and Skeeball are new challenges, UM::Autonomy chose to only focus on 
        completing the Water Blast challenge this year, though work was done throughout the year to 
        complete the Skeeball task in the future.
goal: N/A
