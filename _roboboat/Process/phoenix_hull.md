title: The Phoenix Hull
design: The primary design priorities for the hullform were to optimize stability, thrust to weight ratio, accessibility, and transportability.
vessel: A trimaran hull was chosen to provide a large deck area for accessibility while providing great stability in trim and heel. The Phoenix has a length of
  56”, a beam of 30”, and has an overall height of
  26”.
propulsion: This year the team chose to use two thrusters instead of the four thrusters from last year to allow for greater responsiveness. These thrusters were placed between the hulls to allow for increased transportability. Since the hull is made from carbon fiber, it is light enough that more thursters were not needed for our goal of an increased thrust to weight ratio.
material: Carbon fiber was chosen as the material for the hull because of its lightweight and high strength. This decision would also allow team members to learn and experience different skills that would help them in their careers.
cannon: A spring-based loading and launching systen was used for the skeeball launcher and a DC water pump was used for the water cannon as they are both simple and reliable systems. Both systems are mounted on a common turntable with planetary gears to control yaw aiming. Controlling pitch, however, is done through an axle.

hull_process:
  -
    "1. Design and create CAD models of the hull and boat."
  -
    <br> 2. Use CNC to make parts of the hull and construct superstructure in foam.
  -
    <br> 3. Sand and Duratec the boat molds.
  -
    <br> 4. Multiple carbon fiber layups of the molds.
  -
    <br> 5. Connect the molds together to form the trimaran structure.
