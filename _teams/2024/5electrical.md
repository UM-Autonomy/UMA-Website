Electrical
----------

The Electrical team at UM::Autonomy is committed to the development and refinement of the vessel's electrical systems. With an emphasis on reliability, safety, and maintainability, they focus on integrating failsafes, using off-the-shelf components, and enhancing system modularity.

The team handles the crucial task of setting up a control system that competently converts commands into signals that the vessel's propulsion system can utilize. The balance between responsiveness and safety in this system plays a significant role in the vessel's overall performance.

High on their priority list is the establishment of an efficient emergency stop system. The team constructs this system to account for various potential failure modes, ensuring that a safe and reliable method to halt the vessel is always available, thereby enhancing the reliability of operations.

In sync with their commitment to maintainability and modularity, the Electrical team designs systems that feature standardized, removable connections where possible. This strategy facilitates swift troubleshooting and easier hardware replacement or upgrade, keeping the vessel competition-ready at all times.
