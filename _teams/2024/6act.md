Advanced Capabilities
---------------------

The Advanced Capabilities team designs solutions to tackle the more intricate challenges of the competition that extend beyond fundamental navigation. Balancing the constraints of deck space and system compatibility, they concentrate on crafting reliable, simple, and accurate mechanisms that can be developed and integrated onto the vessel separately.

UM::Autonomy pays meticulous attention to maintaining a consistent system performance under various operating conditions. To handle specific competition tasks, the team prefers solutions that are straightforward yet effective. Every design choice is guided by a commitment to simplicity and reliability, ensuring that the vessel's operations are robust and consistent.

The integration of their designs is done in a manner that reduces system complexity, while enabling unified control. The end goal is always to enhance the operational robustness and reliability of the vessel.
