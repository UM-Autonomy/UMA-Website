Mechanical
----------

The Mechanical subteam focuses on designing and fabricating a competitive vessel each year, striving for a balance between hull stability, system accessibility, modularity in design, and a strategic thrust-to-weight ratio to achieve the team's goals for autonomy at every competition. They not only fabricate the waterproof, hydrodynamic carbon fiber hullforms that house necessary equipment and sensors onboard, but they also carefully plan their vessel design to ensure the effective integration and mounting of these sensors, and any robotic mechanisms necessary for advanced capabilities.
