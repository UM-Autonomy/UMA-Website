The Mechanical team at UM::Autonomy focuses on designing and constructing a competitive vessel, striving for a balance in accessibility, stability, power-to-weight ratio, and portable design. Learning from previous iterations plays a key role in their approach to each annual competition.

The careful planning of their vessel design ensures that necessary equipment and sensors are effectively integrated, contributing to the overall performance and operational stability. Carefully selected propulsion systems enhance efficiency and responsiveness, while also prioritizing transportability and minimizing the risk of malfunctions.
