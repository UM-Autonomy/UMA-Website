# Phoenix sets sail once more—emerging stronger
# from the trials and tribulations of its past,
# UM::Autonomy’s 2024 vessel focuses on
# simplicity in design and workflow in order to
# further ensure a reliable, maintainable, and
# modular system."
description1: "
At the 2025 RoboBoat Competition, The Orca makes its debut as UM::Autonomy’s redesigned autonomous vessel, built from the lessons of two seasons with The Phoenix. Centered around an all-new X-Bow monohull, Orca delivers improved seakeeping and maneuverability to meet the competition’s demands for precise navigation and reliable docking."


# description2: "
# Understanding the tighter time constraints of the 2024
# season, a greater emphasis was placed
# on design validation and in-water testing, which
# was facilitated by maintaining an operable vessel
# and reducing design complexity from last year.
# This design strategy was complemented with a
# testing strategy that relocated the team
# permanently into its testing environment, made
# testing a weekly process from the start of the
# season, and allowed for multiple modes of testing
# to guarantee success."

description2: "
To match this new platform, the team consolidated and standardized its electrical systems for resilience and faster iteration, introducing deeper monitoring over CAN and simplifying power distribution and diagnostics. On the software side, we transitioned to ROS 2 and added wind compensation backed by a matured simulation workflow and rigorous weekly in-water testing, creating a robust, modular foundation for repeatable success across core tasks."
