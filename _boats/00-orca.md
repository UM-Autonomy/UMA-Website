At the 2026 RoboBoat Competition, The Orca sets sail once more, emerging stronger through the all-new X-Bow hull design. UM::Autonomy's 2026 vessel focuses on pushing the limits of every aspect while being more impressive than ever before. "

# description2: "
# Understanding the tighter time constraints of the 2024
# season, a greater emphasis was placed
# on design validation and in-water testing, which
# was facilitated by maintaining an operable vessel
# and reducing design complexity from last year.
# This design strategy was complemented with a
# testing strategy that relocated the team
# permanently into its testing environment, made
# testing a weekly process from the start of the
# season, and allowed for multiple modes of testing
# to guarantee success."

Building on 2025’s mechanical foundation, the 2026 strategy targets optimization and intelligent autonomy. Through custom PCBs and AI-driven perception and autonomy, the team has shifted from prototyping to refinement, relying on a matured simulation workflow to rigorously validate complex behaviors before physical deployment.
