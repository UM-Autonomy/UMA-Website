description1: "At the 2024 RoboBoat Competition, The
Phoenix sets sail once more—emerging stronger
from the trials and tribulations of its past,
UM::Autonomy’s 2024 vessel focuses on
simplicity in design and workflow in order to
further ensure a reliable, maintainable, and
modular system."
description2: "
Understanding the tighter time constraints of the 2024
season, a greater emphasis was placed
on design validation and in-water testing, which
was facilitated by maintaining an operable vessel
and reducing design complexity from last year.
This design strategy was complemented with a
testing strategy that relocated the team
permanently into its testing environment, made
testing a weekly process from the start of the
season, and allowed for multiple modes of testing
to guarantee success."
