subtitle: Joined by our drone, R2-D2
description1: C-3PO is named in reference to the trimaran (three hulls) design of our boat. In previous years, our boat has typically used a monohull design but this year, the trimaran design is used to improve boat stability.
description2: With the continuation of the current roboboat competition virtual format and the uncertainty of the global pandemic, the team wanted to revise the previous iteration of the boat/drone which was unfortunately never completed due to Covid-19.
description3: This meant keeping and making small improvements to areas of strength such as the sensor suite, electrical box system, carbon fiber fiber infusion process, and much of our software while also experimenting with more innovative approaches such as the new hull form, hydrophone system, and addition of a CV/Lidar Deep learning approach. These changes allowed the team to better tackle the RoboBoat competitions challenges and ultimately push the organization to greater heights.
