description1: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced a shutdown and saw a shift in the 2020 RoboBoat competition format to a virtual one.
description2: Although our development cycle and competition period was disappointedly cut short, we believe we have made many important improvements to our design. With new hardware, a reworked sensor suite, and a modified hull form, we looked to bring our autonomous boat design to the next level of professional design.
description3: We believe these changes have greatly improved our ability to tackle the challenges of the Roboboat competition and have enabled future improvements and successes.
