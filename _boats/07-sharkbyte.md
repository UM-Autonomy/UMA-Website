subtitle: Waterproofing and water cooling system
description1: After a strong qualifying run, SharkByte qualified for the finals of the 8th annual RoboBoat competition in first place. "SharkByte took home 3rd place in the finals.
description2: A major design change between SharkByte and previous boats was waterproofing. By using fully waterproof electrical connectors and a water cooling system, SharkByte was more than just splash-proof. The electrical system was new this year to accommodate this.
description3: After moving Hugh Jackmanâ€™s (Sharkbyte's predecessor) deck higher off the water with its taller hulls, it was decided that the waterproofing of the electrical systems would allow the deck to sit much lower to the water. This lowered center of gravity provided increased stability. The main goals of UM::Autonomy this year were the waterproofing and improved hull design.
