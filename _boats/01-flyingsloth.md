description1: The teamâ€™s monumental return to the RoboBoat Competition following the COVID-19 pandemic was met with triumphs as well as hardships. The team decided to refurbish the Flying Sloth from the 2017 competition in order to focus on testing and learning skills that were lost due to the lack of in-person opportunities.
description2: With the Flying Sloth providing a strong foundation for the accommodation of new software and hardware development thanks to the new water blast and skeeball challenges, a new superstructure made of carbon fiber was fitted onto the boat. The goal was to use the strong foundation to design a fast system that provided lots of room for mounting electronics and hardware while being easily accessible.
