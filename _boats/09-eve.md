subtitle: Accompanied by WALL-E, a small land vehicle
description1: Eve took 4th place in the 6th annual RoboBoat competition. The main differences between Eve and her predecessors include a major camera upgrade, as well as a new hull shape and propulsion configuration that allowed for much greater maneuverability, though she used the same electrical system as her predecessor Serenity.
description2: Eve was also accompanied by a small land vehicle named WALL-E who was designed to handle the amphibious landing challenge. Eve also featured a NERF gun that was to be used for a shooting challenge.
description3: The main focus of UM::Autonomy during this year was quality manufacturing and thorough testing.
