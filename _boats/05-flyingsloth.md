subtitle: First trimaran and first entirely SLAM dependent system
description1: "The 2017 competition was a year of firsts for UM::Autonomy: first trimaran, first entirely SLAM dependent system and first total overhaul of our code base."
description2: Our team, almost entirely composed of underclassmen, was awarded 2nd place in the static competition. We achieved this result despite constant hardware breakdowns, which prevented the AI team from doing adequate testing before the preliminary competition. As a result, we could not effectively tune our boatâ€™s thrusters for the strong competition winds and were forced to manually tune during competition runs.
description3: Moving forward we look to simplify the electrical box in order to make processing signal data more efficient, and avoid time-intensive repairs.
