subtitle: First boat to create 3D Point Clouds of its environment
description1: Wolvemarine was built to compete in the 4th annual RoboBoat competition.
description2: Distinctive for its innovative panning Panning Lidar, Wolvemarine was the first boat in competition history to create 3D Point Clouds of its environment. Wolvemarine also featured a new Hull shape that allowed for greater speed through the water.
description3: Although UM::Autonomy took 1st place in the static judging portion of the competition we experienced several technical issues, causing us to do very poorly during the rest of the competition. However, the team did receive the “Edge of the Envelope” award for the major technological advances that were developed.
