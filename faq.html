              <p class="mb-0"><b>Do I need any experience or technical background to join?</b></p>
              <p>Nope! We welcome everyone to build and learn together - no matter if you are a freshman or a graduate
                student; majoring in economics or engineering. Come check us out!</p>

            <div>
              <p class="mb-0"><b>What is the time commitment?</b></p>
              <p>We are flexible: commit as much as you are willing and able to. Generally, members commit around 2-4 hours
                a week but we definitely understand that throughout the semester, priorities and workload could change.</p>

            <div>
              <p class="mb-0"><b>When does the team recruit? How do I become a member?</b></p>
              <p>We recruit all year round! Just add yourself to our mailing list to get periodic updates on team activity
                or send us an email to get added to our Slack channel if you're interested in contributing to the team as a

            <div>
              <p class="mb-0"><b>Is the team active during the summer?</b></p>
              <p>Yes we are! We are less active than during the Fall/Winter semesters but we typically do have some projects
                for
                members to work on throughout the summer. *Update: The team will be taking a break from technical work in
                Summer 2021, with a focus on social
                engagement
                and planning for the upcoming semesters. We currently have weekly game nights and occassional in-person
                social activities.</p>

              <p>Yes! The work you do in our project team can be counted towards MDP Academic Credit. Read more about MDP

              <p>Nope. Nada. $0. Our team obtains materials and equipment from the generous support of the college, industry
                sponsors, alumni and friends. View the list of our sponsors here: <a href="https://umautonomy.com/sponsors"

              <p class="mb-0"><b>What is the team's response to Covid-19?</b></p>
              <p>We offer hybrid opportunities. We shifted most of our work to be done remotely where possible. Where not
                possible, we followed safety guidelines when doing in-person work at the Wilson Center. In summer 2020 and
                2021, the annual RoboBoat competition was shifted from an in-person to a virtual competition.
                <br />
                As it was a challenging year, we placed more focus on providing opportunities for members to learn and
                organized more virtual social events.
