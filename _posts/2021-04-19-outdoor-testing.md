After an entire year of mostly remote work, UM::Autonomy organized our first in-person event to test out the boat and drone we built. As this year's competition is virtual, the testing event was a great opportunity for us to celebrate the effort and time we have put in as a team the past year.

While we had some successes (the boat floated!), we found areas for improvement. We needed to work more on drone calibration before take-off and had some challenges with connecting the boat to our autonomous software component.

Nevertheless, it was extremely satisfying to see the results of our hard work and for the team to be able to have a socially-distanced gathering before the end of the academic year.
