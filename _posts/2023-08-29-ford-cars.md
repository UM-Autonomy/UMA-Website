Last week, our very own Ben Bruick and Asheya Naik had the fantastic opportunity to attend Ford Motor Company's Immersion Day at the Ford Robotics Building on North Campus!

This was a great chance to network and connect with industry leaders, partake in resume coaching and diverse team-building workshops, and learn more about the work done at Ford. The team especially enjoyed their product reviews of the F150 Lightning and Mustang and the vehicle walk arounds.

Ford is a Platinum sponsor of the team and has historically provided the team with lots of technical support in designing, fabricating, and testing carbon fiber hull forms for our boats every year. In the past, they have provided foam molds for our carbon fiber vacuum infusion process (as shown below). 

Thank you to Ford for inviting us to this event, and we look forward to another great competition season made possible through their support!
