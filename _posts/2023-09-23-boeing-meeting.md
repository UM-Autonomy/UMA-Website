Last Wednesday, our team had the great pleasure of meeting with Boeing in the Wilson Center to talk about our team, discuss our performance at the 2023 RoboBoat Competition, and review our boat, the Phoenix!

Boeing has been a Gold sponsor for UM::Autonomy since 2017, providing us with not only the financial support to be able to go to competitions every year but also with yearly design reviews and meet & greets with the team. Weâ€™re incredibly grateful for their continued support, and the opportunity to be able to share our work with them. We look forward to working with them further as we prepare to set sail at the 2024 RoboBoat Competition in February!
