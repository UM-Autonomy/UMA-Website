In our effort to improve remote engagement, we introduced the idea of biweekly informal TED talks, alternated with Game Nights. The idea was simple: anyone on the team could give a small presentation on any topic of their choice at 8pm EST Saturday night. This was also an effort to recreate impromptu whiteboard-type explanations we typically have during non-covid times in-person gatherings.

Some of the TED talks that we had:
