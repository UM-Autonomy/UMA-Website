![CAD design of hulls](/images/blog/boat-build-process/cad.png)

It all started with a 3D design of the hulls by the Hulls and Systems team. This was the first time our team tried a trimaran (3 hulls) hull design.

![Hull preparation](/images/blog/boat-build-process/hull-prep.jpg)

Offshore Spars helped us with the autoclave fabrication of the carbon fiber hulls (Shout&#8209;out to Offshore Spars for their generous support!). We then prepared the hulls by carbon fiber infusion.

Once ready, we carefully broke open the molds containing the hulls.

Next, we trimmed the hulls. As there was a lot of carbon fiber dust involved in the trimming process, we wore respirators and worked at a special area of the Wilson Center, periodically using a vacuum to remove the dust.

![Boat frame](/images/blog/boat-build-process/boat-frame.jpg)

To build the boat frame, we first measured and cut carbon fiber tubes (real-life application of trigonometry). We then used resin to stick the tubes together, using Zip Ties and G&#8209;Clamps to hold them together, and left it for a few days for the resin to harden.

We then worked on cutting out our plywood boat deck.

And on attaching the boat hulls to the frame using more resin.

![Boat fell apart](/images/blog/boat-build-process/fell-apart.jpg)

... Then it all fell apart. Resin wasn't strong enough to hold the boat structure together so we had to think of another method.

![Drill and bolt](/images/blog/boat-build-process/drill-and-bolt.jpg)

Our solution? We drilled holes through the carbon fiber tubes and bolted them to other tubes, to the hulls and to the deck.

The results? A sturdy boat. :)

![Electrical box](/images/blog/boat-build-process/electrical-box.jpg)

Finally, we attached our electrical box and thrusters to our boat.

After cleaning our workspace, we were good to go test our boat!
