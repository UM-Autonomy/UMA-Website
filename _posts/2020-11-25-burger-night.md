In a typical non-covid semester, our team has burger nights where members would hang out together after team meetings/build sessions. With it being remote, we continued our tradition of having burger nights on Wednesdays 8-9pm. The Central Student Government (CSG) generously granted us the opportunity to refund members for one of our burger nights.
