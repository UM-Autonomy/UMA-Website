      <p>Sarasota, Florida</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://robonation.org/programs/roboboat/" target="_blank">RoboNation RoboBoat</a> is an international
        competition
        where students design, build, and compete with
        autonomous surface vessels, in a series of tests aimed at challenging teams through a
        variety of autonomous (self-driving) tasks. We will be joined by 27 other teams from 4 continents.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3 id="competition-strategy">Competition Strategy</h3>
    <div class="my-4">
        <!-- Due to the short build cycle this year—just 5 months from competition details to competition—we decided to reuse
        our <a href="{% include relative-src.html src='/history/2024/' %}">2023 hull, <i>The Phoenix</i>, albeit with
          major structural improvements</a>. We focused on simplicity in design
        and workflow in order to further ensure a reliable, maintainable, and modular system. Understanding the tighter
        time constraints of this season, we put a greater emphasis was placed on design validation and in-water
        testing, which was facilitated by maintaining an operable vessel and reducing design complexity from last year.
        We moved to testing strategy that relocated the team permanently into its testing environment, made testing a
        weekly process from the start of the season, and allowed for multiple modes of testing to guarantee success. -->
      <p>
        Following the success of our previous 2-year design cycle with the Phoenix, we continued this strategy with the
        <a href="{% include relative-src.html src='/history/2025/' %}">Orca hull</a>. This year marks the second iteration of
        the Orca, incorporating targeted improvements to enhance stability, increase internal capacity, and improve propulsion
        efficiency based on competition data and performance analysis from last year.
      </p>
      <p>
        Building upon a proven hull geometry allowed our mechanical team to implement refinements with greater confidence, while our AI team advanced software capabilities and system reliability in parallel. We improved our computer vision pipeline, developed smarter onboard memory systems to address last year's navigation challenges, and upgraded our path planning algorithms for smoother, more efficient paths. The electrical team streamlined our systems with custom PCB designs to reduce complexity and improve maintainability.
      <p>
        Understanding that competition success comes from tested and reliable systems, we emphasized thorough validation from the start. Our simulator with realistic wave dynamics allowed continuous parallel development, while monthly in-water testing sessions ensured our improvements worked in real conditions. This measured, iterative approach reflects our commitment to building consistently reliable and competitive vessels.

    <h3 id="static-judging-criteria">Static Judging Criteria</h3>
    <p>
      Besides a team's performance autonomously, we are judged on aspects of both our team and the
      boat.
    </p>
    <h4>Design Documentation</h4>
    <p>
      The team must prepare a website, <a
        href="{% include relative-src.html src='/technical_design_report/orca.pdf' %}" target="_blank">a
        technical
        design report</a>, and
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0z6G2oO8Qlk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a video</a> for judges to
      score. These are evaluated based on how well they introduce the team and its structure
      as well as design considerations of the boat.
    </p>
    <h4>Presentation</h4>
    <p>
      The team must present to the judges live their decisions leading to the design of the boat.
    </p>
    <h3>Other Judging Criteria</h3>
    <p>
      Before the boat can participate in an autonomous challenge, several prerequisite activites
      must be completed.
    </p>
    <h4>Static Safety Inspection</h4>
    <p>
      As the boats are very high powered, a runaway boat could damage itself and hurt others.
      Therefore, competition staff ensure that the boat follows several safety rules:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The boat stops when a physical red button is pressed on the boat</li>
      <li>
        The boat stops when a remote switch is flipped, or the remote switch loses power or
        connection
      </li>
      <li>
        The boat does not have any sharp edges so that people in the water can touch the boat safely
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      UM::Autonomy is proud to have been one of the first three teams to pass the safety inspection at the 2025
      competition. We have continued this spirit throughout the 2025-2026 year: safety is considered highly
      in all situations, from battery and testing site training to ensuring the vessel is safe at all times.
    </p>
    <h4>Boat Thrust-to-Weight Ratio</h4>
    <p>
      The competition rewards fast and light craft. Therefore, a sliding scale is used where points
      are lost faster the heavier it gets. The boat is weighed and its thrust is measured every day
      it is entered in the water. The Orca 2.0 weighs 50 pounds, the lightest weight
      class.

    <h3 id="autonomy-challenge">Autonomy Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      The main part of the challenge is the tasks that the vessel must perform autonomously. However, we must first
      qualify before we perform autonomous operation on the full course.
    </p>
    <h4>Qualification</h4>
    <p>Teams will be given opportunities to practice, display their capabilities, and earn their spot in the final
      round. They will have access to three duplicate courses, each containing the eight tasks. Throughout this time,
      teams can choose to test strategies, gather data, or qualify for tasks. A certain level of completion—"minimum
      performance criteria"—is required to complete a task. Once a team has qualified for enough tasks, they enter the
      Semi-Final rounds.</p>

    <h4>Semi-Finals</h4>
    <p>Teams must score some number of points in Semi-Finals rounds to progress to Finals.
    </p>

    <h4>Finals</h4>
    <p>
      Teams who have successfully qualified will have access to the finals courses. Importantly, each vessel must
      operate autonomously for the entire duration of the run; remote-controlled survey runs are not allowed. This means
      teams cannot manually control their vessels to gather data or assess the field before or during their time slot,
      emphasizing the critical importance of pre-run preparation and programming accuracy. They will be required to
      navigate through initial gates, attempt a series of tasks in their chosen sequence, and finally return to the home
      base to conclude the run. All teams making it to the final round will secure a higher final ranking over those who
      do not reach this stage of the competition.

      <dd>
        This challenge is mandatory before attempting other tasks. The ASV needs to pass through two
        sets of gates (a pair of red and green buoys) and starts autonomous navigation at a minimum
        of 6 ft before the set of gates.
      </dd>

      <dt>Analysis</dt>
      <dd>
        As it is mandatory, this challenge is of high importance. In 2019, the boat could only
        successfully pass the Entry & Exit Gates once out of four qualification runs as a result of
        a major electrical failure onboard. In 2025, it was completed with high success due to our extensive testing in
        water and in simulation.
        However, additional tuning was needed upon arrival to the competition site as the boat's computer vision system
        would occasionally fail to detect a buoy and the gps calibration sometimes failed.

      <dd>
        To complete the Navigation Channel task, Task Planning identifies red and green buoys in the path. 
        These are then used to create a spline interpolation of the path, which builds a curve of the path layout based on points on the curve denoted by red and green buoys. 
        This spline algorithm then creates waypoints in a curve, and remembers these for the end of the task. 
        Each waypoint is then sent to Navigation, which uses an A* algorithm to generate an optimal path from the vessel's current location. 
        This algorithm accounts for the vessel's dynamics and places high-cost zones on either side of the gates to ensure it travels between the buoys. 
        As a result, the vessel receives reliable, accurate routes to follow.

        The vessel notes in other tasks the location of the speed light buoy or the starting red and green buoys, and uses these to get to the beginning of this task. 
        The vessel will then move forward until it sees the location and color of the light buoy, and then preempts the forward movement and either uses waypoints to 
        circle left if it sees a green light beacon, or right if it sees a red light beacon. The vessel uses the navigation and controls algorithm to avoid any black buoy debris.

        The vessel will constantly listen for the harbor sound and will abandon the task it is on, saving state such as location and current progress. 
        To process the audio signal, we first apply the Hanning window to the audio stream. 
        This prepares the data to get passed through the Discrete Fourier Transform, after which we have a spectrum of frequencies and their magnitude. 
        We check whether the designated frequency of 600, 800, or 1000 Hz is in this spectrum and at a large enough magnitude. 
        If so, we start tracking the length of time that this frequency persists for. 
        If this matches either of the signal patterns, this gets sent to Task Planning. 
        Task Planning will proceed to stop the current task, making note of location and task progress at this point,
