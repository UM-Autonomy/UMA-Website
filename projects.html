          We employ a vast and diverse set of skills here at UMA. We have 
          members of all levels of experience and from a wide variety of majors. 
          Our subteams include AI, Electrical, Hulls and Systems, Drone and Business. 
          The AI team develops all things software for our team, which entails
          developing path planning algorithms, computer vision, and simulation. 
          Our Electrical team does all things electrical such as working with 
          our computer hardware onboard and sensors. Hulls and Systems designs and develops
          our carbon fiber hull. Meanwhile, the Drone team takes a multidisciplinary 
          approach to building a drone from the ground up. Lastly, the Business team 
          manages our team sponsorships and budget.

          Path Planning
        </h2>
        <p class="editable">
          In 2018, we made a huge step toward returning to success. We finished
          7th overall and 3rd among American Universities. For 2019, 
          we restuctured our team which reflected great potential for our team in 2020 
          as this allowed us to get 1st place in static judging in the 2019 competition. 
          Unfortunately, due to Covid-19, the 2020 in-person competition was cancelled.
          This year, we plan to focus on giving members both in-person and remote opportunities to 
          learn and get involved.
