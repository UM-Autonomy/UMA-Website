          What is UM::Autonomy?
        </h2>
        <p class="editable">
          UM::Autonomy is an award-winning undergraduate student project team
          from the University of Michigan. Each year we build an autonomous boat
          to participate in the RoboNation Roboboat competition. The boat is
          completely designed and programmed by students and must complete a
          wide range of challenges that are designed to test its autonomous
          abilities. We aim to further the study of autonomous robotics at the
          University of Michigan by providing students with hands-on
          multidisciplinary design experience in artificial intelligence, image
          processing, navigation, naval architecture, and mechanical design.
          Each year we strive to push the physical and conceptual bounds of our
          autonomous vehicle.

          Moving Forward
        </h2>
        <p class="editable">
          In 2018, we made a huge step toward returning to success. We finished
          7th overall and 3rd among American Universities. For 2019, we restuctured our team which reflected great potential for our team in 2020 
          as this allowed us to get 1st place in static judging in the 2019 competition. For 2020, 
          we aim to go reap the potential we saw in 2019.

        <p class="editable">
          Each year we look for motivated, talented individuals looking to make
          a splash in the world of autonomous vehicles. UMA has no selection
          process or time commitment requirements, so just show up to our Sunday
          meetings at 1012 FXB from 1-3 to get started with us. If you have any more
          questions, don't be afraid to reach out to us at umautonomy@umich.edu!
