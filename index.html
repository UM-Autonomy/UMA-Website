        <h1>What is UM::Autonomy?</h1>
        <p class="editable">
          UM::Autonomy is an award-winning student project team
          from the University of Michigan. Each year we build an autonomous boat
          to participate in the
          <a href="https://robonation.org/programs/roboboat/" target="_blank">RoboNation RoboBoat competition</a>.
          The boat is
          completely designed and programmed by students and must complete a
          wide range of challenges that are designed to test its autonomous
          abilities. We aim to further the study of autonomous robotics at the
          University of Michigan by providing students with hands-on
          multidisciplinary design experience in artificial intelligence, image
          processing, navigation, naval architecture, and mechanical design.
          Each year we strive to push the physical and conceptual bounds of our
          autonomous vehicle.

        The RoboBoat competition is an international competition where students design, build, and compete with
        self-driving robotic boats, in a series of tests aimed at challenging teams through a variety autonomous
        (self-driving) tasks. In 2023, we were joined by 22 other teams from 4 continents. UM::Autonomy placed 6th
        overall, and 3rd among American Universities.

        Rising from the ashes of defeat and disorder following the pandemic, UM::Autonomy's 2023 boat, the Phoenix,
        soared to competition with
        renewed pride, a greater sense of togetherness, and a singular focus: to compete hard while having fun.
        Made entirely out of carbon fiber to reduce weight, the boat features two
        large thrusters for speed and a Ryzen 5600X CPU to make autonomous decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a hard-fought competition the previous year, the team chose to focus on four principles for this year:
        decoupling,
        reliability, maintainability, and performance. Not only was the AI pipeline decoupled and tested separately, but
        nearly
        all major components of the boat could be separated, making it extremely modular and maintainable. It was the
        first year
        that the team tested in the Marine Hydrodynamics Laboratory, and did so for over 100 hours. In addition, it was
        the
        first year that the boat was made out of carbon fiber from scratch—from the painstaking mold making,
        preparation, and
        vacuum resin infusion—in order to produce a boat that weighed less than 60 pounds while still delivering
        impeccable
        results.

        UM::Autonomy has around 60 members across many different majors, including Computer Science, Electrical
        Engineering, Robotics, Naval Architecture, Art & Design, and Business. We are organized into several teams:
        Artificial Intelligence, Electrical, Mechanical, Advanced Capabilities, and Business. The Artificial
        Intelligence team is broken up into distinct subteams, which are Navigation & Controls, Task Planning, and
        Computer Vision.
