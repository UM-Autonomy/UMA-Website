          What is UM Autonomy?
        </h2>
        <p class="editable">
          UM::Autonomy is an award-winning undergraduate student project team
          from the University of Michigan. Each year we build an autonomous boat
          to participate in the
          <a href="https://robonation.org/programs/roboboat/" target="_blank">RoboNation Roboboat competition</a>.
          The boat is
          completely designed and programmed by students and must complete a
          wide range of challenges that are designed to test its autonomous
          abilities. We aim to further the study of autonomous robotics at the
          University of Michigan by providing students with hands-on
          multidisciplinary design experience in artificial intelligence, image
          processing, navigation, naval architecture, and mechanical design.
          Each year we strive to push the physical and conceptual bounds of our
          autonomous vehicle.

          members of all levels of experience and from a wide variety of majors.
          Our subteams include AI, Electrical, Hulls and Systems, Drone and Business.
          The AI team develops all things software for our team, which entails
          developing path planning algorithms, computer vision, and simulation.
          Our Electrical team does all things electrical such as working with
          our computer hardware onboard and sensors. Hulls and Systems designs and develops
          our carbon fiber hull. Meanwhile, the Drone team takes a multidisciplinary
          approach to building a drone from the ground up. Lastly, the Business team
          manages our team sponsorships and budget.

          Brief History
        </h2>
        <p class="editable">
          In 2018, we made a huge step toward returning to success. We finished
          7th overall and 3rd among American Universities. For 2019,
          we restuctured our team which reflected great potential for our team in 2020
          as this allowed us to get 1st place in static judging in the 2019 competition.

          Now and the Future
        </h2>
        <p class="editable">
          This year looked towards allowing members to learn with remote opportunities and
          training. Our focus was to prepare our new members with knowledge for the upcoming
          year through various projects.

          For next year, we are excited to have our new members get hands-on experience. We
          have a lot prepared, so we are ready for 2021-22!

          Each year we look for motivated, talented individuals looking to make
          a splash in the world of autonomous vehicles. UMA has no selection
          process or time commitment requirements. Next year, we will develop
          bite-sized projects for new members to onboard more smoothly and get a
          glimpse on the type of work we do. If our team and our opportunities

          FAQs
        </h2>
        <div>
          <p class="mb-0"><b>Do I need any experience or technical background to join?</b></p>
          <p>Nope! We welcome everyone to build and learn together - no matter if you are a freshman or a graduate
            student; majoring in economics or engineering. Come check us out!</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p class="mb-0"><b>What is the time commitment?</b></p>
          <p>We are flexible: commit as much as you are willing and able to. Generally, members commit around 2-4 hours
            a week but we definitely understand that throughout the semester, priorities and workload could change.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p class="mb-0"><b>When does the team recruit? How do I become a member?</b></p>
          <p>We recruit all year round! Just add yourself to our mailing list to get periodic updates on team activity
            or send us an email to get added to our Slack channel if you're interested in contributing to the team as a
            member. Feel free to send us an email if you want to learn more about the projects we do or have any
            questions.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p class="mb-0"><b>Is the team active during the summer?</b></p>
          <p>Yes we are! We are less active than during the Fall/Winter semesters but we do have some projects for
            members to work on throughout the summer.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p class="mb-0"><b>Can I earn credit through UM::Autonomy?</b></p>
          <p>Yes! The work you do in our project team can be counted towards MDP Academic Credit. Read more about MDP
            here: <a href="https://mdp.engin.umich.edu" target="_blank">https://mdp.engin.umich.edu</a></p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p class="mb-0"><b>Are there any fees to join?</b></p>
          <p>Nope. Nada. $0. Our team obtains materials and equipment from the generous support of the college, industry
            sponsors, alumni and friends. View the list of our sponsors here: <a href="https://umautonomy.com/sponsors"
              target="_blank">https://umautonomy.com/sponsors</a></p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p class="mb-0"><b>What is the team's response to Covid-19?</b></p>
          <p>We offer hybrid opportunities. We shifted most of our work to be done remotely where possible. Where not
            possible, we followed safety guidelines when doing in-person work at the Wilson Center. In summer 2020 and
            2021, the annual RoboBoat competition was shifted from an in-person to a virtual competition.
            <br />
            As it was a challenging year, we placed more focus on providing opportunities for members to learn and
            organized more virtual social events.
          </p>

        <div>
          <p class="mb-0"><b>How do I support the team?</b></p>
