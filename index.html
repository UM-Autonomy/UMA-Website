					What is UM::Autonomy?
				</h2>
				<p class="editable">
					UM::Autonomy is an award-winning undergraduate student project team from the University of Michigan.  Each year we build an autonomous boat to participate in the RoboNation Roboboat competition.  The boat is completely designed and programmed by students and must complete a wide range of challenges that are designed to test its autonomous abilities.

					We aim to further the study of autonomous robotics at the University of Michigan by providing students with hands-on multidisciplinary design experience in artificial intelligence, image processing, navigation, naval architecture, and mechanical design. Each year we strive to push the physical and conceptual bounds of our autonomous vehicle.				</p>

					Opportunities at UMA
				</h2>
				<p class="editable">
					We employ a vast and diverse set of skills here at UMA. Our subteams' responsibilities include developing artificial intelligence, 
					designing a carbon fiber hull, assembling the sytems and electronics of the boat, and managing the team budget and sponsorship.

					Moving Forward
				</h2>
				<p class="editable">
					In 2018, we made a huge step toward returning to success. We finished 7th overall and 3rd among American Universities.
					For 2019, we are a team reinvented. Come see this year as we overhaul everything in pursuit of RoboBoat 2019!

					Will you join us?
				</h2>
				<p class="editable">
					Each year we look for motivated, talented individuals looking to make a splash in the world of autonomous
					vehicles. UMA has no selection process or time commitment requirements, so just show up to our Sunday meetings at 
					1571 GGB to get started with us. If you have any more questions, don't be afraid to reach out to us at umautonomy@umich.edu!
