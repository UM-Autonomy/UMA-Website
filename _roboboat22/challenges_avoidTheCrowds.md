category: challenges
priority: high
title: Avoid The Crowds
description: The ASV passes through between multiple sets of gates (pairs of red and green buoys) 
        and avoids intermittent yellow buoys
analysis: The challenge requires minimal external hardware or software development and mainly just 
        involves careful navigational operability and fine motor control. This challenge could be 
        tested and fine-tuned really early in the development process. 
goal: 9 out of 10 successful runs
