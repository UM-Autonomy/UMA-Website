title: Magellan's Route / Count the Manatees & Jellyfish
description: The ASV passes through between multiple sets of gates (pairs of red and green buoys) 
        The ASV also avoids intermittent yellow buoys (jelly fish) and black buoys (manatees) of 
        various sizes and counts them
analysis: The challenge requires minimal external hardware or software development and mainly just 
        involves careful navigational operability and fine motor control. This challenge could be 
        tested and fine-tuned early in the development process. 
goal: 9 out of 10 successful runs
