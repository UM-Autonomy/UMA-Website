priority: high
title: Navigate the Panama Canal
description: This challenge is mandatory before attempting other tasks. The 
            ASV needs to pass through two sets of gates (a pair of red and green buoys) and starts
            autonomous navigation at a minimum of 6 ft before the set of gates.
analysis: As it is mandatory, this challenge is of high importance. In 2019, the 
        boat could only successfully pass the navigation channel once out of four 
        qualification runs as a result of a major electrical failure onboard.
goal: 14 out of 15 successful runs
