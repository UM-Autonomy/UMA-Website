title: Feed the Fish
description: The ASV detects the "feeding table" (purple frame), then lines up and shoot three "pellets" 
             (racquetballs) through the frame into any of the three holes. Points are awarded if the ball 
             is fired into any of the holes but less points are awarded for just landing the ball on the deck. 
analysis: As both the Water Blast and Feeding the Fish are new challenges, UM::Autonomy chose to only focus on 
        completing the Water Blast challenge this year, though work was done throughout the year to 
        complete the Skeeball task in the future.
goal: N/A
