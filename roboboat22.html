        <h2>Competition Strategy</h2>
        <div>
          <h3>Team Focus</h3>
          <p>
            For this competition season, our team decided to reuse the Flying Sloth hull from our 2017 competition.
            This allowed for greater focus on testing and on learning skills that the team lost due to the graduation
            of more experienced members and the lack of in-person opportunities the last 2 years due to covid.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Thrust-to-Weight Ratio</h3>
          <p>
            The usage of foam hulls instead of carbon fiber hulls means that the boat is heavier. 
            To account for this, more thrusters are used, and we decided on using a six-thruster setup.
          </p>
        </div>

          <h3>Prioritization of Challenges</h3>
          <div>
            <h4>High Priority Challenges</h4>
            <div>
              <h5>Navigation Channel</h5>
              <p>
                Description: This challenge is mandatory before attempting other tasks. The 
                ASV needs to pass through two sets of gates (a pair of red and green buoys) and starts
                autonomous navigation at a minimum of 6 ft before the set of gates.
              </p>
              <p>
                Analysis: As it is mandatory, this challenge is of high importance. In 2019, the 
                boat could only successfully pass the navigation channel once out of four 
                qualification runs as a result of a major electrical failure onboard.
              </p>
              <p>
                Goal: 14 out of 15 successful runs
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h5>Snack Run</h5>
              <p>
                Description: The ASV enters the gate buoys, maneuvers around the mark buoy, and exits
                thought the same gate buoys, as quickly as possible. The timer starts when the bow (front) 
                crosses the gate buoys and stops when the stern (back) crosses the gate buoys
              </p>
              <p>
                Analysis: Based on the 2019 score-sheet, a time between 25-45s is needed to remain 
                competitive in the Snack Run challenge, with the fastest 2019 run coming in at 27 seconds                
              </p>
              <p>
                Goal: 9 out of 10 successful runs + baseline of 35 seconds, goal of 26 seconds
              </p>
